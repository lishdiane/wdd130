                    <p>Here at White Water Adventure, we are determined to show people the fun that mother nature has to offer. We think that everyone should try white water rafting at least once in their life and we offer many different packages for people of all different skill levels.<br><br>“A river is more than an amenity, it is a treasure” – Oliver Wendell Holmes. </p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Back in 1969 our grandfather, John Davis, had a vision to get people outside and show them how to love rafting. He would have never guessed that his buisness would be what it is today. For more than 45 years White Water Adventure has brough joy and adventure to people all over the world.</p>
