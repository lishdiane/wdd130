            <p>Hello! I am Diane Lish and I am a mother of 4 kids. My house is full of life including: a cat, a dog, a frog, a parrot, and chickens. I live in Idaho, and living near the mountains means we love camping, kayaking, hiking and spending time outdoors!
                I have recently gone back to school and am working toward getting a degree in software development. I have learned that I really love working with different kinds of
                programming and am excited to continue on my way toward my degree. Some things I like to do in my spare time are read, decorate cakes, going on walks, and playing board games. 
            </p>

            <p>Beautiful mountains and stunning lanscapes are just some of the reasons to love Idaho. The state capitol, Boise, is located in southwest Idaho and is surrounded by 4.7 million acres of forest. With over 100 mountain ranges and more than 3,000 miles of rivers, Idaho has endless adventures for the outdoor enthusiast. If food is the way to your heart, Idaho is famous for its potatos, huckleberries, morel mushrooms, wine, and much more. Whatever your interests Idaho is sure to be able to meet them. </p>
